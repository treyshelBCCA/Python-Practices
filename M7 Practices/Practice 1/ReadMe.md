# Python Practice: Data Persistence with Text Files

## Objective

This exercise focuses on practicing data persistence in Python using text files. You will learn how to store, retrieve, update, and manage structured data within a text file.

## Tasks

1. **Define a Data Structure**

   Define a data structure (e.g., dictionary or class) to represent items with attributes such as name and quantity.

2. **Write to a Text File**

   Write the items to a text file (`inventory.txt`). Each item should be stored on a new line in the format `"name: quantity"`.

3. **Read from the Text File**

   Implement a function to read from `inventory.txt` and print each item in the format `"name - quantity"`.

4. **Update and Write Back**

   Create a function to update the quantity of a specific item and write the updated items back to `inventory.txt`.
